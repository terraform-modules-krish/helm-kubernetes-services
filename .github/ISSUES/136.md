# Add support for Statefulset deployments

**rvc-mf** commented *May 18, 2022*

I would like to add support for Statefulset deployments to this helm chart. I believe this can be done with relatively few (and non-breaking?) changes:
  - Add an optional field called `workloadType` to `values.yaml`, where the default value is `deployment` but `statefulset` is also an option. 
  - Add a `_statefulset_spec.tpl` template which gets used when `workloadType` is set to `statefulset`. In turn, `_deployment_spec_tpl` only gets used when `workloadType` is set to `deployment`. 
  - Add an optional `updateStrategy` field to `values.yaml` which gets injected into `updateStrategy` on `statefulset` workloads (`workloadType: statefulset`). `deploymentStrategy` continues getting injected into `strategy` on `deployment` workloads.  
  - Add an optional `name` field under `service` due to Statefulset workload requirements. `service` could still have `enabled: false` if the service resource is created outside of the chart.

I consider these changes possibly non-breaking because as long as the default value of `workloadType` is `deployment`, the chart should behave exactly as it does currently. Also, I don't expect any downtime implications from these changes.

An alternative would be creating different helm charts for statefulset deployments, but I think time will be better spent upgrading this Chart instead.

That being said, is there anything that I'm not seeing that could become a problem with this approach? I'm planning on coding this up soon, but I'd appreciate any feedback üëçüèº.
