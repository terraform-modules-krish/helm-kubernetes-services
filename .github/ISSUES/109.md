**Describe the bug**

IAM Role for Service Accounts has a bug where non-root Docker containers are not able to read the kubernetes token when it is projected due to file permissions. To work around this, you need to be able to configure the `fsGroup` property. See https://github.com/aws/amazon-eks-pod-identity-webhook/issues/8 for more information.

**To Reproduce**
Use `k8s-service` helm chart with IAM Role for Service Accounts using Kubernetes version <1.19, and a docker container that does not run as root.

**Expected behavior**
The container can assume the bound IAM Role.

**Actual behavior**
The container is not able to assume the bound IAM Role.
