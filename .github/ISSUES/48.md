# k8s-service should support HPA

**paul-pop** commented *Dec 6, 2019*

The current version of `k8s-service` does not support HPA (https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale). 

As it has a pretty complex API in terms of custom metrics, a starting point would be to just allow passing in `minReplicas`, `maxReplicas` and the for the `metrics` block to support the `Resource` type to be able to limit CPU and memory.
