# Allow for setting securytcontext for a container

**tverhoeven** commented *Jul 17, 2019*

We are using the k8s-service chart with great succes. But we recently stumbled on a issue. One of the container images that we need to deploy needs to run in privileged mode.

This means that we need to be able to set:
        securityContext:
          privileged: true
in the deployment record.

But currently the chart does not allow you to specifiy this or any other securityContext settings. Could this be added to the chart?

Thanks, Tim

That's a good idea to add! We are pretty buried right now so might not get to this in the short term. Would you be up for a PR?
