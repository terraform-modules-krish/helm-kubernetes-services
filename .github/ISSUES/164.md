# Support Startup Probes

**dataviruset** commented *May 30, 2023*

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Support Startup Probes for the deployment spec, just like there's already support for Liveness and Readiness Probes.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Modifying the chart locally or using something like Kustomize to add the field into the deployment spec afterwards, but this feels unnecessarily complicated as I feel startup probe support could benefit many users of this chart.

**Additional context**
[Official Kubernetes documentation of the feature](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/)
