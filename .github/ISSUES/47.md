Server side is not needed which will makes things way easrier. 
Is this version of Helm supported under this module?

hi @pgold30 not at the moment, we were waiting for Helm 3 GA to be released. Would you be up for a PR?

Hi @robmorgan  Helm 3 was released 9 days ago : https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/tag/v3.0.0. 
I would be up for using it when its developed.

We are now testing on helm 3 and have verified that the chart, as is, will work on helm 3 without any modifications.
