# Secrets management

Find a way to seamlessly integrate `SealedSecrets`.

Or consider `gruntkms` or `sops` such that secrets are decrypted as they are mounted into pods as an alternative. Need some way to ensure the IAM role scope is inherited from the Pod config.

@yorinasub17 Can the bitnami's Sealed Secrets Controller be used for this purpose?

Ah yes SealedSecrets is probably the right way to go for this!

This issue might be supplanted by https://github.com/gruntwork-io/helm-kubernetes-services/issues/118. Leaving open in case there's still a need for `SealedSecrets`.
