# Add support for disk-based emptyDir volumes

**jonnymatts-global** commented *Sep 2, 2021*

We would like to create and use `emptyDir` volumes that are backed by disk. #91 added the ability to create `emptyDir` volumes as `scratchPaths`, however the implementation is hard-coded to use tmpfs via the `medium: "Memory"` option provided to the `emptyDir` spec.

What would be the best way to approach adding support for disk-based `emptyDir`s?

Is there an ETA by when this will be released? We are depending on this feature.
