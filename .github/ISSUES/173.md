**Describe the solution you'd like**
I would like to be able to specify the dnsPolicy for my k8s-service so that I can use something other than "ClusterFirst". 

Add dnsPolicy as an optional value in the values.yaml file and add it to the deployment if set.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I've been patching deployments after deploying.

**Additional context**
