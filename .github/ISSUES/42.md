# deleting k8s-service leaves route-53 records

**mcalhoun** commented *Oct 1, 2019*

When deleting the `k8s-service` via `terraform destroy` leaves the `route-53` records in place and they need to be cleaned up manually.

The DNS records are managed in the [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/external-dns) app, so this can be done if you switch to using `sync` mode for managing the records.

Going to close this as we resolved in slack. For posterity, this isn't something we can control in the chart, and must be handled at the installation point for `external-dns`. Let me know if you still need help!
