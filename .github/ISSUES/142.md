**Describe the solution you'd like**

This helm template already offers us the possibility of overriding the `ENTRYPOINT` from the Dockerfile by using the `containerCommand` input variable. It is super nice, but there are situations in which I don't want to override the entrypoint, but I want to pass custom arguments to my container using the `args` provided by kubernetes (the CMD in the Dockerfile). For reference: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/#use-environment-variables-to-define-arguments

Is there a reason why it is not implemented? It should be something simple to do and I'm happy to open a PR with that.
