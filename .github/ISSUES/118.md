**Describe the solution you'd like**
Many service providers are starting to integrate with [the Secrets Store CSI driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/secrets-store-csi-driver) to provide a mechanism for injecting external secrets into the Pods. For example, AWS has [an official provider](https://github.com/aws/secrets-store-csi-driver-provider-aws) for using this mechanism to inject Secrets Manager Secrets into Pods as volumes.

We should update the `k8s-service` chart to allow one to inject such a volume into the Pod.
