# Add support for Chart Hooks

**melhin** commented *Jan 12, 2022*

Is there a way to define cronjobs in this setup.
also we have some pre-install preupgrade jobs that we would like to run is there a mechanism for that ?

Are these features in pipeline or they already available and Im not able to find them ?

The `k8s-service` chart's main function is deploying application containers with a `Deployment` resource. I think a `CronJob` would call for a separate chart. We don't currently have plans for that.

I assume you're referring to [Chart Hooks](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts_hooks/). We don't currently support those. While it's a valid feature request, we probably have to triage this first. There are multiple things to consider:
- Which resources types would we support (`Job`, `Pod`, `ConfigMap`, `Secret`)?
- Would we limit the amount of resources to one or allow multiple?

Thank you for the reply @autero1 üëçüèæ .

Just out of curiosity is there a particular reason for not supporting CronJob charts in k8s ?

I would say that time is the biggest limiting factor üòÉ . We have an [issue for supporting `Job` resources](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/helm-kubernetes-services/issues/24) and haven't really had time to prioritize working on it.

Converting this issue to track the feature request for [Chart Hooks](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts_hooks/) support. We'll track `CronJob` support in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/helm-kubernetes-services/issues/24.
