# k8s-service should support canary deployments

**yorinasub17** commented *May 31, 2019*

Right now the `k8s-service` helm chart does not include support for a canary version. This feature request is to enhance the existing chart to deploy a new canary `Pod` that maps to the n+1 version of the container that is hooked up to the `Service` and `Ingress` resources.

Needs some thinking about the design, in particular the input variables.
