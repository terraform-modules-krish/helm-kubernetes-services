**Describe the bug**
If you have a `ConfigMap` and `Secret` that has the same name, you can't mount both as a volume due to a volume name collision. This is because the template will name both volumes as `NAME-volume`.

The proposed fix is to support specifying a custom volume name to avoid the collision. E.g.,

```yaml
configMaps:
  myconfig:
    as: volume
    mountPath: /etc/myconfig/config
    volumeName: myconfig-configmap-volume
```


**To Reproduce**
- Create a `ConfigMap` and `Secret` that has the same name (e.g., `myconfig`).
- Try to mount both as volumes:

```yaml
configMaps:
  myconfig:
    as: volume
    mountPath: /etc/myconfig/config

secrets:
  myconfig:
    as: volume
    mountPath: /etc/myconfig/secrets
```

**Expected behavior**
Mount both the `ConfigMap` and `Secret` as a volume.

**Actual behavior**
Error:

```
Helm install failed: Deployment.apps "myapp" is invalid: spec.template.spec.volumes[1].name: Duplicate value: "myconfig-volume"
```
