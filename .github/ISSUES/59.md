**yorinasub17** commented *Jan 24, 2020*

e.g being able to specify:

```
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: foobar:latest
        name: go-test-monitor-container
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        env:
          - name: DD_AGENT_HOST
            valueFrom:
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: status.hostIP
          - name: DD_ENTITY_ID
            valueFrom:
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: metadata.uid 
```

Suggested implementation is to expose an input value called `additional_container_env` which can be used to pass in raw list items that are rendered for the `env` map.
