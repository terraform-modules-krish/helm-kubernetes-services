# PodDisruptionBudget created even if minPodsAvailable=0

**mloskot** commented *Feb 24, 2023*

TL;TR: I'm having a problem with PDB-s being re-created, looks like after every update to my pods, despite setting `minPodsAvailable=0`. I also posted my story as part of this question to K8s forum: [How to find what event creates PodDisruptionBudget?](https://discuss.kubernetes.io/t/how-to-find-what-event-creates-poddisruptionbudget/23202)

### Problem

The current default `minPodsAvailable` which I also use in my copy of the chart is Zero:

https://github.com/gruntwork-io/helm-kubernetes-services/blob/628c207e703885633e91b6aaddd4635a65518ab4/charts/k8s-service/values.yaml#L317-L318

Then, no PDB should be created according to:

https://github.com/gruntwork-io/helm-kubernetes-services/blob/628c207e703885633e91b6aaddd4635a65518ab4/charts/k8s-service/templates/pdb.yaml#L1-L4

That is because, after [Helm docs](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/control_structures/) (rookie here :)), the condition is:

> evaluated as _false_ if the value is numeric zero


Now, if I `grep` all my code, YAML, templates, etc. for `minPodsAvailable` and `minAvailable`, I see no other occurrences of the two than the referenced above `pdb.yaml` and `values.yaml`.

Why Kubernetes keeps re-creating PodDisruptionBudget-s for my pods deployed with the chart?

### Workaround

I found a workaround this problem by patching the `pdb.yaml` 

```diff
- {{- if .Values.minPodsAvailable -}}
+ {{- if kindIs "float64" .Values.minPodsAvailable -}}
```

to let the chart create PodDisruptionBudget for `minPodsAvailable = 0` but it will create it with with `minAvailable=0`.

Then, it 'works' like there was no PDB, so pod can be evicted without problems during nodes draining.

Hi @mloskot, thanks for opening this Issue. 

Could you provide a little more detail on what you are experiencing? 

Did you deploy the `k8s-service` chart initially with `minPodsAvailable  = 0` (the default) but a PDB is still being created? Or was the chart deployed initially with `minPodsAvailable` set to something other than `0`, but now the PDB isn't being removed when updating to `0`? 

Running a `helm template` with the default setting doesn't render a PDB manifest. Are you deploying the chart directly to the cluster via a client CLI (`kubectl` or similar), Terraform/Terragrunt, or something else?

It is about the problem which is described at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/azure-kubernetes/error-code-poddrainfailure

> Did you deploy the k8s-service chart initially with minPodsAvailable  = 0 (the default) but a PDB is still being created?

Yes, as I explained above, I'm using `k8s-service` defaults regarding PDB-s but `minPodsAvailable = 0` has no effect due to this buggy comparison

https://github.com/gruntwork-io/helm-kubernetes-services/blob/75c2eb82a442701b00300181d5f268270d19b201/charts/k8s-service/templates/pdb.yaml#L4

In the description of this issue I explained fix-or-workaround to this, so it should be clear what is missing.

Hi @mloskot, I'm still not quite sure I fully understand the issue. I understand PDB's blocking Node Drains as well as other blocking operations that PDBs can cause. What I'm trying to zero in on what the issue is with the `k8s-service` helm chart. 

If you deploy the `k8s-service` Helm chart with `minPodsAvailable: 0`, then the PDB should not be created -- the template should not even render based on this conditional `{{- if .Values.minPodsAvailable -}}`. Are you reporting that the PDB is being created for the `k8s-service` Helm chart when deploying even when `minPodsAvailable: 0` is configured? If this is the case, could you provide details on how you are deploying the `k8s-service` chart including details of the system (steps to recreate)? 

I'm not seeing this behavior on my end, so having the steps to recreate with system info will help to try and recreate the issue. I just did an install of the chart with a couple different configurations:
- Installed initially with a PDB, then upgrade to set `minPodsAvailable: 0` and PDB was removed.
- Installed initially without a PDB (`minPodsAvailable: 0`), confirmed PDB not deployed.
- Installed initially without a PDB, confirmed PDB not deployed, updated `minPodsAvailable: 1`, PDB then deployed.

Info such as:
OS
Helm version
Kubernetes/EKS version (maybe AKS)
k8s-service version
...

Steps to recreate (example):
1. With the following values overrides: 
```yaml
containerImage:
    repository: nginx
    tag: 1.14.2
    pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
applicationName: canary-test
replicaCount: 3
canary:
    enabled: true
    replicaCount: 3
    containerImage:
        repository: nginx
        tag: 1.16.0
livenessProbe:
    httpGet:
        path: /
        port: http
readinessProbe:
    httpGet:
        path: /
        port: http
service:
    type: NodePort
minPodsAvailable: 1
```
3. Deploy Helm chart: `helm install k8s-service`
4. Expected deployed manifests/resources: 
5. Actual resources deployed: `kubectl get all,pdb -l "app.kubernetes.io/instance=k8s-service"`
Also, if you could share the deployed yaml of the PDB that would be helpful as well: `kubectl get pdb -l "app.kubernetes.io/instance=k8s-service" -o yaml`

Are you reporting that the PDB is being created for the k8s-service Helm chart when deploying even when `minPodsAvailable: 0` is configured?

I'm reporting that  `{{- if .Values.minPodsAvailable -}}` is (or used to be) incorrect for `minPodsAvailable: 0` and should read `{{- if kindIs "float64" .Values.minPodsAvailable -}}` instead. However, it's possible that it was an issue in templates interpretation by Helm version I used during Jan/Feb and perhaps Helm behaviour has been corrected in more recent versions. 
Unfortunately, I can not remember what version of Helm I used to be using.

But, as I pointed earlier, there is a history of `{{- if .Values.minPodsAvailable -}}` condition being unreliable, see https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/3164 

However, copy of [charts/k8s-service](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/helm-kubernetes-services/tree/main/charts/k8s-service) that I'm currently using includes this workaround patch of  `{{- if kindIs "float64" .Values.minPodsAvailable -}}` and PDB-s are not created for me. 

I will try to remove that patch and see if currently used Helm version can correctly interpret  `{{- if .Values.minPodsAvailable -}}` condition.

UPDATE: FWIW, this PDB-s issue happened to me before I updated my copy of [charts/k8s-service](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/helm-kubernetes-services/tree/main/charts/k8s-service) to contain this update https://github.com/gruntwork-io/helm-kubernetes-services/pull/114, perhaps that was what actually solved the problem. Sorry if this issue has become chaotic, but it's been a while and I'm a Helm newbie :)

Hi @mloskot, no worries! The important thing is that we get whatever issue you are running into, resolved. I do agree that the conditional statement for PDB creation could be a bit more explicit via a boolean, such as: 
`{{- if .Values.pdb.enabled -}}` 
as opposed to potentially problematic string/number/float type comparisons which aren't as deterministic at times. 

If you are enabled and no longer running into issues with this, I'd like to go ahead and close out this Issue. 

I think we will add a backlog item as well to update the creation conditional to a boolean as opposed to how it is today.

I can confirm that having the `float64` removed and using the defaults of `minPodsAvailable: 0`

I no longer see unexpected PDB-s created. Yes, I think this issue can now be closed.

Thank you for the investigation of this.
