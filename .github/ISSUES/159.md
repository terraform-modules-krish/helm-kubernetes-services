**Describe the solution you'd like**
Support for `priorityClassName` (stable as of k8s v1.14) to assign a PriorityClass to deployments creating using the k8s-service helm chart.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I am not aware of a viable alternative method of adding `priorityClassName` to k8s-service based deployments other than adding support to the helm chart.

**Additional context**
[priorityClassName documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-priority-preemption/#pod-priority)
