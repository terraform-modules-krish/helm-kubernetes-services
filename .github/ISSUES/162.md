# Support Vertical Pod Autoscalers

**reynoldsme** commented *Apr 3, 2023*


**Describe the solution you'd like**
It would be great to have support for Vertical Pod Autoscalers (VPAs) in the k8s-service module just like horizontal pod autoscalers are supported today.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
The only alternative would be to manage the VPA as a separate object, which while possible, feels like it deviates from the Gruntwork model.

**Additional context**

Hi @reynoldsme thank you for submitting the request. I didn't see VPA support in terraform resources, but we will review adding VPA in our eks modules soon.
