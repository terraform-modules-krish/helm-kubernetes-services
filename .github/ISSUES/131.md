**Describe the solution you'd like**
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/helm-kubernetes-services/issues/24 is for tracking a new helm chart for packaging applications into a `Job` or `CronJob`, assuming that is the main deployment model of the app (e.g., a batch processing job, or periodic scanner app that scans for vulnerabilities).

However, there are use cases for a `Job` or `CronJob` to augment a service deployment, such as for running a one time database migration on upgrades. For this use case, it is better to embed the `Job`/`CronJob` resource in the `k8s-deployment` helm chart.

This ticket is for tracking the integration between the `k8s-job` and `k8s-service` charts so that `k8s-service` can be used to invoke `k8s-job` to deploy one time tasks for the app.
