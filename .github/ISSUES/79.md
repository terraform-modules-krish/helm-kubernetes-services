# Add support for configuring Persistent Volumes

**austinphilp** commented *Oct 9, 2020*

We recently began a project in which we planned to configure a EFS instance as a persistent volume using the [AWS EFS CSI Driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-efs-csi-driver). 

However, we quickly found that although we can terraform the PersistentVolume and it's PersistentVolumeClaim, we have no way to use the Gruntworks Helm Chart.

it seems that volumes are supported on the existing helm chart, but only for mounting configs and secrets. We would like to be able to utilize persistentVolumes on our k8s pods via our `values.yaml`, since as far as we can tell, there's currently no way to utilize PersistentVolumes with the helm chart provided by this repo.

Thanks,
<br />

This has been addressed with #80 and v0.1.4, so going to close.
