# support for envFrom for secrets

**ecasilla** commented *Dec 3, 2020*

This change helps avoid having to enumerate all secrets and keep the management of the secrets isolated to the secrets config and not both the secret config and the chart.

EDIT: Ah I misread the k8s docs. This makes sense to me! We're a bit buried right now, so the best bet to get this sooner would be a PR.

IGNORE BELOW

This should already be supported. See https://github.com/gruntwork-io/helm-kubernetes-services/tree/master/examples/k8s-service-config-injection#injecting-the-secret-in-to-the-application

Or are you thinking of something else?
