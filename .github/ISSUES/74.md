# Surfacing Additional Pod Labels

**TRReeve** commented *Sep 4, 2020*

I would like propose adding an additional field for the user to add additional labels to the pod deployed by the helm chart.

Use case is I am working with EKS Fargate and it allows you to mark what should be deployed to a fargate managed node using the namespace or a combination of namespace and labels. Potentially we'd like to enable mixing EC2 and Fargate deployed pods inside the same namespace using labels to denote that a k8s-service should be deployed to fargate, while still using the gruntwork helm chart to lower operational overheads. 

I was imagining this could take the form of an  additionalPodLabels: {} and additionalDeploymentLabels: {} argument in values.yaml with the accompanying mapping being passed to the appropriate sections of deployment.yaml. With respect to my usecase this would mean we could say to fargate "deploy anything with label pair x to fargate" and then in our gruntwork chart we can add that label in values.yaml. 

Any thoughts would be appreciated as If I'm missing something obvious that everyone else does to add additional labels to helm deployments using the chart that makes this redundant then would be useful to know.

This sounds reasonable! Would you be up for a quick PR to add these in?

Yes I can give this a shot later when I'm not on the day job.
