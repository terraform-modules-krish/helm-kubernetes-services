# Networking control guide and any modules to support it

**yorinasub17** commented *Jan 14, 2019*

Provide a guide on how one can use [Network Policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) to restrict access to pods at the Kubernetes network layer. There should be a link to this from the security group docs.

If any modules seem useful for improving the experience of defining Network Policies, then build those out as well.
