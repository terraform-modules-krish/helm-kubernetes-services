Thanks for your contribution! Apologies for the delay in responding here! I lost track of this and just remembered to look.

This look like a great escape hatch to have here, but we will definitely want to document that this should only be used for resources that are not supported by the chart so that it isn't abused.

We can definitely move forward to add this in, once the following two things are added:

- A template test case
- Documentation in the README
