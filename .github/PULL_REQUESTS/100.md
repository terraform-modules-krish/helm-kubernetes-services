This one is failing because the `go` binary is not resolvable via the `PATH` when the `go mod tidy` command in the `setup` job is run. 

I started digging into why. I've been running the build locally with the help of [the Circle CI CLI ](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/?utm_medium=SEM&utm_source=gnb&utm_campaign=SEM-gb-DSA-Eng-uscan&utm_content=&utm_term=dynamicSearch-&gclid=CjwKCAjwoZWHBhBgEiwAiMN66SEHzcuwp_2xdZhJpbJmaA79g0Pj2SjKMQ2qXpu8JtGbXLHGbQy14RoCVScQAvD_BwE)and this command to just run the failing `setup` step: 

```
circleci local execute --job setup --env GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN=$GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN
```


When we first call `install_gruntwork_utils` we in turn call `configure-environment-for-gruntwork-module` with the configured `go-version` [here](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-ci/blob/master/modules/gruntwork-module-circleci-helpers/bin/configure-environment-for-gruntwork-module#L229).

This leads to a symlink from `/usr/local/go/bin/go` to `/usr/bin/go` being created.

However, it seems when this binary attempts to query `go`[ to confirm the installed version](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-ci/blob/master/modules/gruntwork-module-circleci-helpers/bin/configure-environment-for-gruntwork-module#L233) it fails: 

```
/usr/local/bin/configure-environment-for-gruntwork-module: line 211: go: command not found     
The installed version of Go is now 
```

Took a stab at a fix in 8ddf86b.

@ina-stoyanova all yours - but thank you! :+1:  Just added that on because I've been running into similar issues recently with my own git-xargs PRs.
