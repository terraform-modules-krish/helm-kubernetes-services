## Description

Fixes incompatibilities of the `ingress` spec arising from updating to the `networking.k8s.io/v1` API version. To ensure this over time, this PR updates the test infrastructure to ensure that both versions are tested, in template and integration mode.

## TODOs

- [x] Ensure the branch is named correctly with the issue number. e.g: `feature/new-vpc-endpoints-955` or `bug/missing-count-param-434`.
- [x] Update the docs.
- [x] Keep the changes backwards compatible where possible.
- [x] Run the pre-commit checks successfully.
- [x] Run the relevant tests successfully.
