Do you think it would be appropriate to state explicitly somewhere in the docs that we are using Helm 3 now? I think enough developers are aware of the significant changes between 2 and 3 with the removal of the server side component.

I don't really want to mention that yet, as this chart still works with 2 and 3. Don't want to give the false impression that this doesn't work on helm 2.
