# Adding termination grace period

**meganjohn** commented *Jul 21, 2021*

Adding the terminationGracePeriodSeconds option to enable configuration for time the pod needs to shut down before deletion.  Explicitly defaults to the standard Kubernetes default of 30 seconds.

Template test will be added to this PR at a later stage by a member of my team as part of a sprint ticket for grace period implementation.  Thanks for your comments!
