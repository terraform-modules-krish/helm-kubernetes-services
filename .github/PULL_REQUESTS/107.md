# Adding termination grace period logic

**martinhutton** commented *Sep 15, 2021*

Adding the terminationGracePeriodSeconds option to enable configuration for time the pod needs to shut down before deletion.

Kubernetes API documentation: https://v1-18.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.18/#pod-v1-core

A [PR](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/helm-kubernetes-services/pull/102) of the same changes was raised by [Megan](https://github.com/meganjohn) but as she is now on leave we're unable to updated the original PR. As a consequence we have raised another to cover the original changes and address the comments (update values.yaml and add a template test).

Apologies for the confusion and let me know if there are any issues.
