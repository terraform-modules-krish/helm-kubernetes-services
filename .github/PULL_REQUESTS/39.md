# Add IRSA injection

**yorinasub17** commented *Sep 20, 2019*

This adds support for injecting the required annotations to the pod spec for the deployment to project the Service Account token into IAM credentials using IRSA. You can read more about the spec in the blog post for [IAM Roles for Service Accounts](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/introducing-fine-grained-iam-roles-service-accounts/).
