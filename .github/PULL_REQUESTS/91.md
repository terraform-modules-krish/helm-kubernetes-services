# Add feature to mount tmpfs volumes

**yorinasub17** commented *Feb 5, 2021*

This implements a new feature that allows you to mount `tmpfs` volumes to arbitrary paths in your container. See the docs for `scratchPaths` input value for more info on the semantics.

This uses the `emptyDir` volume [in kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir).
