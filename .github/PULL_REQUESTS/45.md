# Update README to the new format for service catalog

**yorinasub17** commented *Oct 28, 2019*

This PR updates the `README` for `helm-kubernetes-services` as per [the Service Catalog README RFC](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/mission-control/blob/master/rfc/service-catalog-readme.md).

I just realized this has been hanging for quite some time! I think I still need an answer to the question above. Maybe @eak12913 can pitch in?

@yorinasub17 internally we would represent that using: 

```
"licenseType": "subscriber"
```

The current possible values for that field are: 

```
licenseType: "subscriber" | "open-source" | "unimplemented";
```

This may be a little bit moot because we're not currently even crawling these frontmatters.

Ah let me clarify the question a bit since that doesn't quite answer it:

This repo is currently open source, but the README will now include a link to a repo that is for Gruntwork subscribers under the "Production" list. Should this link to the github page, or the service catalog so that non-subscribers can view something? Or is that automatically handled when the asciidoc is pulled in?

Going to merge this in now.
