__~Depends on terratest: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/pull/237~ merged__
__merges into feature branch:  https://github.com/gruntwork-io/helm-kubernetes-services/pull/7__

This implements the most basic example of using `k8s-service` to deploy nginx, and provides a detailed walkthrough of the steps to deploy it. The goal is to:

- Show a sample `values.yaml` file that you might use to deploy your app
- Walk through the operational steps to deploy the chart
- Interactively show some of the features of the `k8s-service` chart.

## Gates for merge

- [ ] Guide code review
- [ ] Test code review
- [x] Implement integration test for the example
