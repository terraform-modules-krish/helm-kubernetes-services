## Description

Do not set the number of replicas if the horizontal pod autoscaler(HPA) is enabled. This will avoid conflicts between helm deployment and the HPA.

Warning: on upgrade to this chart version, the number of pod replicas ->1 -> `minReplicas` set in the HPA section of `values.yaml`

This has been tested using `k8s-service-nginx` example.  
1. With Initial conditions: 
```yaml
replicaCount: 3
horizontalPodAutoscaler:
  enabled: false
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 5
```
the pod count is `3`.  

2. Turn on HPA: 
```yaml
replicaCount: 3
horizontalPodAutoscaler:
  enabled: true
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 5
```
and do `helm upgrade` and the pod count changes to `2`

3. Apply change and run `helm upgrade` the pod replica count goes down to `1` temporarily before reverting `2`
4. Change replicaCount to `4` and do helm upgrade
```yaml
replicaCount: 4
horizontalPodAutoscaler:
  enabled: true
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 5
```
and pod count remains at `2`.
