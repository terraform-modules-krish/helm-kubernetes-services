# Add a new test for prometheus ServiceMonitor and fix ServiceMonitor

**yorinasub17** commented *Oct 28, 2019*

This also updates to go modules so that the prometheus operator can be pulled in as a dependency.

NOTE: I will be merging this in given the build passes, but feedback is welcome! Will address any issues in future PRs.
