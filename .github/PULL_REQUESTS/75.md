# Surfacing Additional Pod Labels for user

**TRReeve** commented *Sep 5, 2020*

RE: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/helm-kubernetes-services/issues/74

Added two arguments to the values template and in the deployment to allow a user to add additional labels to their pod and deployment. These are provided by additionalDeploymentLabels:{} and additionalPodLabels:{} that the user can provide a map to the same as the annotations arguments. 

I was contemplating adding something to the matchLabels as well but I felt that might open up a can of worms with the core functionality of the template providing a single deployment so I left that in the end.

The main aim is to allow users to integrate gruntwork templates with other labelling schemes they would be running in their k8s workload as well as the mentioned use case in the issue where labels are required for certain tagging and operational uses by other systems. 

I don't think there should be any reason for compatibility issues for existing users.
