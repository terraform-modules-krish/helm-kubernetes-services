# Chart deployer

**yorinasub17** commented *Feb 26, 2019*

This PR includes the pipeline to package the helm chart into a tarball for distribution. This will also publish a `index.yaml` that acts as the index of all the charts released. As a part of this, the chart version is now injected at package time when a release tag is made, so that we don't forget to update the chart versions.

Once we are ready to go live, I will hook up a pipeline to the `helmcharts` repo that will take this `index.yaml` and append it to its `index.yaml`.

Merging this because it is working, but since it is going in a feature branch, can address any issues from a review there.
