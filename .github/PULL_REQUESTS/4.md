# Add pre-commit hook for helm lint, update copyright, and update contribution guide

**yorinasub17** commented *Feb 6, 2019*

- Introduce pre-commit hook that will run `helm lint`: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/pre-commit/pull/7
- Update boilerplate `README` to remove trailing whitespace
- Update copyright year
- Update `CONTRIBUTING.md` with `pre-commit` info.

NOTE: Going to merge this in right away since it is only boilerplate README changes. If there are any typos or terrible mistakes, feel free to leave comments even after the fact and I will fix them.
