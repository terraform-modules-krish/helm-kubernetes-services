<!-- Prepend '[WIP]' to the title if this PR is still a work-in-progress. Remove it when it is ready for review! -->

## Description

Enables support for custom args on deployment spec. The current helm only allows custom commands, making it hard to reuse the image by changing the args only and keeping the command (ENTRYPOINT).
It is supported by Kubernetes, for reference: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/#use-environment-variables-to-define-arguments.

Gist with [template tests](https://gist.github.com/thiagosalvatore/e02bb81f610d5003fe5f1382b9487188)

Implements #142

## Release Notes (draft)

<!-- One-line description of the PR that can be included in the final release notes. -->
Added / Removed / Updated [X].

[X] - Added new input parameter `containerArgs` that can be used to define custom args that should be passed to the deployment spec. It behaves exactly as the `containerCommand`, the only difference is that it will populate the `args` instead of the `command` in the spec.
