# Verify Helm 3 compatibility

**yorinasub17** commented *Feb 28, 2020*

This updates the test suite to use the latest terratest version with Helm v3 compatibility, and the CircleCI environment.

Note that there were no changes to the underlying chart itself, indicating that the current version of the chart works with both helm v2 and helm v3.
