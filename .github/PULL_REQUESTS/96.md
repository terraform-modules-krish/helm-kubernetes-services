# allows for the fullname to be overidden in the values

**ralucas** commented *May 25, 2021*

There's no current way to explicitly define the fullname that appears in deployments, services, etc.  Given that a user may want this ability, particularly if they are running multiple k8s-services in the same cluster.  This pull request enables users to override the fullname through the `fullnameOverride` key.

@yorinasub17 @rhoboat Could one of you take a look?

Build passed, so we can merge this once you add the `fullnameOverride` to the `values.yaml` and resolve the merge conflict.
