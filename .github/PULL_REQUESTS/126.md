## Description

<!-- Write a brief description of the changes introduced by this PR -->
This PR fixes a bug where the number type checking for ingress port expression isn't good enough when passing through a number with `values.yaml`. `helm` seems to coerce numbers into strings when going through a `values.yaml` file, which doesn't happen when using `--set`.

This PR also adds a regression test to make sure we test the path with `values.yaml`.

## Additional note

The regression test expectedly fails without the fix in adc83736d7b09d6332d5350d37dd0fb9d3b783b8 (see build https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/gruntwork-io/helm-kubernetes-services/343/workflows/8e969b8a-2c9e-4b1f-819d-e15fb52ff958), but passes after the fix (see https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/gruntwork-io/helm-kubernetes-services/344/workflows/a0eeb12e-f372-4005-894b-0e54d3843364)
