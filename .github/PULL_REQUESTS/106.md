# feat: add support node backed emptyDirs

**jonnymatts-global** commented *Sep 3, 2021*

Resolves #105, adding support for node backed `emptyDirs`. 

I have added the `emptyDirs` input to `values.yaml`, which takes a map of volume name to mount path. 

I used the new input instead of changing the existing `scratchPaths` input to ensure backwards compatibility.

I have configured the template such that each `emptyDir` volume has the configuration:

https://github.com/gruntwork-io/helm-kubernetes-services/blob/91e901bf035871f3df9c388d3504b5c3bfe8d32d/charts/k8s-service/templates/_deployment_spec.tpl#L390-L393

I could also set it up so that the user could pass the emptyDir configuration through themselves as part of the map.
