Any chance for a quick look and this a potential release so k8s 1.23 gets the support it needs?

@autero1 Can you please re-check? Hopefully this gives other contributors some examples on how to test capabilities and server versions during the render. 

I've also fixed the pre-commit hook for `helmlint` and updated it to the latest version as the previous one was returning a warning:

```
âžœ  helm-kubernetes-services git:(fix/145/hpa-api-version-compatibility) pre-commit run --all-files                   
[WARNING] Unexpected key(s) present on https://github.com/gruntwork-io/pre-commit: sha
