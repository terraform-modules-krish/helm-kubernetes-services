# Example code, quickstart guide, and tests for config injection

**yorinasub17** commented *Mar 11, 2019*

This PR introduces a new example `k8s-service-config-injection`, which is meant to demonstrate how one would configure their applications deployed using the `k8s-service` Helm Chart.

- A quickstart guide walking through how you would run each example and highlighting the specific input value that configures the app.
- Dockerized sample app that can take in an environment variable.
- Helm Chart values that can be used to configure the app in various ways.
- Kubernetes resource files that create supporting resources (e.g `ConfigMap`)
- Terratests that test all of the above.

I'm going to go ahead and merge this in so we can release it. If there are any issues found in a post-merge PR review, I'll address in a new PR.
