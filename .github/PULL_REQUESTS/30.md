# Enable setting additional paths on ingress

**yorinasub17** commented *Aug 16, 2019*

Sometimes it is desirable to add additional path rules to the ingress resource. For example, if you wanted a HTTP => HTTPS redirect rule with the ALB ingress controller, you need to create a special catch all path that does the redirect (see https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-alb-ingress-controller/guide/tasks/ssl_redirect/). This path needs to be injected before the application service path. Or you might want to create a route for a side car container that is deployed in the service.

To support these use cases, this PR introduces two new input values `additionalPaths` and `additionalPathsHigherPriority` that can be used to inject additional path rules to the ingress resource.
