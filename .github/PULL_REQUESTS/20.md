# Fix Ingress bugs

**yorinasub17** commented *Apr 4, 2019*

__~This depends on https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/pull/273 and https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-ci/pull/91~ Both are merged and PR is updated to point to released versions__

This fixes several bugs found in the `Ingress` resource template:

- The API group is `extensions/v1beta1`.
- There was a typo in one of the if conditions.
- The rules required setting a `host`, but sometimes you want the ingress to match all hosts. This supports that.

To flush these bugs out, I implemented a test that verifies that the chart correctly provisions an ingress resource and that you can access a service using the ingress endpoint.

FYI @robmorgan this morphed quite a bit since you last viewed it, so recommend taking another look. See the updated description for all the details.

I am going to go ahead and merge this, given that I am actually blocked on this now. Feedback is welcome, and if there are any issues identified, will address in another PR.
