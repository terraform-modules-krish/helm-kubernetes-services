# feature/init-containers

resolves #103. Please let me know if this is what you had in mind. Will then add tests + a documentation block for initContainers in `values.yaml`. 

Tested locally so far and seems to work.

Okay, I've updated the doc and added a template test. Let me know if there's any other changes I should make. Thanks!

Any chance we could get a second review on this soonish? I'd like to move our company off of my fork and back to the official gruntworks chart asap. Thanks again.
