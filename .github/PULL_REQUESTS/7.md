# k8s-service feature branch

**yorinasub17** commented *Feb 11, 2019*

__This branch will be used to track the `k8s-service` helm chart__

This initial PR contains the README and inputs documentation for the `k8s-service` helm chart. There will be subsequent PRs that merge into this one, at the end of which will complete the `k8s-service` helm chart.

Note that since helm chart development is a relatively new concept for us, I had to prototype the chart first before I could decide on testing and README. As such, I have an implementation PR that goes with this README PR, before both tests and examples. Note that the implementation is separate from the README PR to facilitate easier review.

Here are the gates before this can be merged:

- [x] Documentation review (this PR in its initial form)
- [x] [Implementation review](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/helm-kubernetes-services/pull/8)
- [x] Unit tests (template tests)
- [x] Examples
- [x] Integration tests
- [x] config injection Usage example
- [x] config injection integration tests
- [x] `helm tests`
- [x] CircleCI
- [ ] Gruntwork helm repo
