# Only expose port 80 and use http name for service

This updates the chart so that we only expose one port by default (80), and makes it easier to update that port. Specifically, now if you need to expose port 3000 instead you only need to set `containerPorts.http.port = 3000`. You do not need to touch the `service` input.

Context: The old way probably was not the canonical use case, and the use case we saw in our mob coding exercise is more likely to fit 80-90% of the cases. This change will thus provide a better UX for that canonical use case.
