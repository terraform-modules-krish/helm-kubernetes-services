# Make cert name configurable

**autero1** commented *Aug 23, 2019*

This PR makes the certificate name configurable. As the certificate name needs to be referenced in the ingress, users of the chart need full control over the name of the certificate. Now the name was the `fullName`, which meant that the chart user wouldn't know the name without reading the chart source code.
