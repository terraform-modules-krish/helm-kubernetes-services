# Refactor deployment spec to DRY the main and canary

This refactors the deployment.yaml and canarydeployment.yaml specs to use a single, common template to avoid having replicated configuration that can lead to drift.

Thanks for the review! Will merge, but won't release. I'll start building the scratch space feature on top of this, and we can release when that is ready!
