# Add support for mounting persistent volumes

**austinphilp** commented *Oct 21, 2020*

Following Issue #79 and [this slack thread](https://gruntwork-community.slack.com/archives/CHH9Y3Z62/p1600730139039500) and I've added support for mounting a Kubernetes Persistent Volume onto a service pod using this helm chart.

I've added a persistentVolumes input to the `values.yaml` which will allow the user to define one or more already created persistent volumes to be mounted on the container. 

As this is a purely additive change, there should be no issues regarding backwards compatibility for consumers of this helm chart
