@eak12913, it looks like the changes in this PR are only for the ordering of the names, but no changes otherwise. Is this needed?

I was running a script that removed folks who have since moved on from Gruntwork. At the same time I figured that I'd alphabetize the existing entries. This repo had no one to remove, but it sorted the existing members. The idea would be to standardize the codeowners file. Not strictly needed but it would make things more consistent.

Hi @eak12913 , did you want me to handle getting this merged and closed? Wasn't sure if you had some automation in place that would handle that as well. Just let me know!
