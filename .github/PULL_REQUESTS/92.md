# Update ingress api version

**ecasilla** commented *Mar 15, 2021*

Update the ingress api version I was seeing `extensions/v1beta1 Ingress is deprecated in v1.14+, unavailable in v1.22+; use networking.k8s.io/v1 Ingress` in my logs

Hmm looks like there is a test failure when targeting minikube, k8s version 1.17. Here is the relevant error message:

Thanks for the initial contribution! This was handled as a part of https://github.com/gruntwork-io/helm-kubernetes-services/pull/114, where we use capabilities introspection for better api version selection.
