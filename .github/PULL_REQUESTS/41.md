# Fix sidecar and additionalpaths rendering

**yorinasub17** commented *Sep 23, 2019*

This PR fixes:

- https://github.com/gruntwork-io/helm-kubernetes-services/issues/40: `sideCarContainers` did not render correctly in the deployment
- https://github.com/gruntwork-io/helm-kubernetes-services/issues/37: `additionalPaths` and `additionalPathsHigherPriority` required a `serviceName` when using with `hosts`.

Added regression tests for each case to ensure the issue is actually fixed.
