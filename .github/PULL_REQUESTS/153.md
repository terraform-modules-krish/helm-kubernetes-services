<!-- Prepend '[WIP]' to the title if this PR is still a work-in-progress. Remove it when it is ready for review! -->

## Description

Adds support for `hostAliases`, as per #111 

It was necessary to make the configuration a list, since a map has non-deterministic ordering and order is important in the `/etc/hosts` file.

I also fixed a couple small typos I came across in docs.

Let me know if you want anything changed!
