Thanks for making the updates! I kicked off a build and it passed, but to further verify the changes, I wrote a new test (ae501966a30a00f93ee1fb3b6beb46b8fc979229) that pulls in the prometheus-operator source code and verifies the schema of the `ServiceMonitor` and it looks like the way you are rendering the input is incorrect. I also wrote the fix (f5e5c72f4edb9fa82992bba230cbbb15fa7cb103).

Given that, I am going to merge this in, and merge in my fixes before releasing it. Thanks for your contribution!
