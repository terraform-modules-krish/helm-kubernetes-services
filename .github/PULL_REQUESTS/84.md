# Deployment strategy

**MaxKam** commented *Nov 13, 2020*

Issue #64 

Added support for configuring deployment strategies on the Deployment resource. 
Results from test run are here in this [Gist](https://gist.github.com/MaxKam/b425e096e55eed01fd3d8ddbf83d7727).
Just adding some options so shouldn't be any issues with backwards compatibility. 

Do you want me to add this to the canary deployment and the examples?
