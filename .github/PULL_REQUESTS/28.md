# Improve the docs based on feedback

**yorinasub17** commented *Aug 13, 2019*

This addresses two issues with the docs:

- It is confusing which links are external and which links are internal. This updates the link text and surrounding context to provide hints on whether or not something will link externally or internally.
- The doc does not mention how to undeploy, so added a new section on undeploying the nginx service.
