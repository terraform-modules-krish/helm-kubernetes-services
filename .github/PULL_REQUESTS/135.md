## Description

This change is to allow the `containerImage.tag` key to support both SHA256 digest image values as well as standard tag labels like `master` or `latest`.

When a SHA256 value is specified, then the `_deployment_spec.tpl` will generate an image line like...

`image: "nginx@sha256:15b5f7f28672bbbf26f058928b16ecb465843845fafe5ea9a06b05a590709150"`

rather than...

`image: "nginx:latest"`

The change is fully backward compatible with existing tag usage.

Tested by running the "-tag tpl" go test scripts, plus the following...

```console
% helm template . --set-string containerImage.repository=fred,containerImage.tag=sha256:15b5f7f28672bbbf26f058928b16ecb465843845fafe5ea9a06b05a590709150,applicationName=fred,canary.enabled=true,canary.containerImage.repository=fredx,canary.containerImage.tag=sha256:15b5f7f28672bbbf26f058928b16ecb465843845fafe5ea9a06b05a590709150 > run1.txt

% helm template . --set-string containerImage.repository=fred,containerImage.tag=latest,applicationName=fred,canary.enabled=true,canary.containerImage.repository=fredx,canary.containerImage.tag=latest > run2.txt
```

Thanks for the PR @tpayne!
This LGTM! We should probably have a regression test for this - can you add a template test that makes sure the templates render correctly?
